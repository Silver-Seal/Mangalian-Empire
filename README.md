The current version of the mod on GitHub is now playable, and with the 1.16 update more states have been added to the middle east, the current version includes the 1930 start date, the world map state changes, and the rework of the main menu and music.


Countries, ideas, decisions, and AI logic need to be added, as well as some completed focus trees that just need to get pushed to the repository. 


If you would like to test the mod, clone the repository and place it into Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod, and change the %user% to the windows account name account name then the game should detect it.

This is the dev branch were changes can be made.
